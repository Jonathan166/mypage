        <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/site-images-pics/build.png" width="320" height="300"/>
        <p>Build Yourself daily. That's right. Work on yourself daily, mentally and physically. If you are going to watch TV then watch a documentary or something educational.
            Not the news. Taking small productive steps daily will have a massive impact on your well being.</p>

        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/site-images-pics/work.png"/>
        <p>Projects in Progress. Setup projects to work on. I find rather than watching instructional videos on how to learn something, have a endgame in mind.
            For example, rather then learning HTML through videos, plan to build a website. Having this goal gives you drive and something to strive for.</p>
